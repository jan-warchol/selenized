Palette modules
---------------

This is a collection of small python modules defining color palettes, that can
be used with my config templates.

Selenized palettes are all defined parametrically using a common python module
`selenized_base`.

There are also some other (non-selenized) palettes in `3rd-party/`, mainly for
the purpose of being able to try them and compare to selenized.
