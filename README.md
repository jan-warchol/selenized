After researching perceptually uniform color spaces, _4 years of testing_,
refining hues and fine-tuning lightness using professional grade [CIE
Lab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space) color space, the task of
redesigning venerable Solarized is almost finished!
Results:

* Easy on the eyes.
* **Beautiful**, vibrant and easily **distinguishable** accent colors.
* **Great readability** and better compatibility with Web Content

Compatibility notes
-------------------

Some command-line programs may need reconfiguration to look good with Selenized,
because they make assumptions about the colors configured in terminal (see
[this issue](https://github.com/janek-warchol/selenized/issues/7) for details):

- [`ls`](dircolors/)
- [Midnight Commander](mc/)

However, this is quite rare; vast majority of software works great
out-of-the-box.

About the name
--------------

The name of the project is derived from the greek word "selene", which means
_the moon_ - as opposed to _the sun_ in Solarized.
