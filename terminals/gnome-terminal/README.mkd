Selenized Palette for Gnome Terminal
====================================

Scripts for making your Gnome Terminal _selenized!_ :-)



Installation
------------

Clone this repository, run interactive installation script and follow the
instructions:

    git clone https://github.com/janek-warchol/selenized
    ./selenized/terminals/gnome-terminal/install.sh

You can also run one of the `set_XXXX.sh` scripts to directly set the desired
theme to the active gnome-terminal profile.

**Note:** You may need to install `dconf-cli` or `gconf2` package (depending on
your Gnome version) to be able to run these scripts.  This should be as easy as
running `sudo apt-get install <package>`. 

**Warning:** the colors in the target profile will be permanently overwritten -
there is no undo.  Consider creating a new profile before installing Selenized.
