Selenized palette for iTerm
===========================

_**Note:** the default terminal emulator on OS X is Terminal.app, not iTerm!_

I recommend all Mac users to use iTerm rather than the default terminal -
firstly because iTerm has some very nice features (like split panes and
autocompletion), and secondly because it doesn't mangle your colours [like
Terminal.app does](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/29487/172274).  You can
download iTerm here: <http://www.iterm2.com/>.



Installation
------------

* Download Selenized palette files from this folder.
* Open iTerm, go to Preferences, click on the "Profiles" icon and select the
  "Colors" tab.
* Click on "Load Presets", select "Import..." and choose one of the palette
  files.  
  You have now added a new preset to iTerm, but it's not applied to any profile
  yet.
* To use the preset, select a profile from the list on the left, click on "Load
  Presets" and choose a preset.
