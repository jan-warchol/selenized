Selenized palette for Terminal.app (OS X default terminal)
==========================================================

OS X default terminal is broken!
--------------------------------

Using Selenized with OS X default terminal is problematic. That's because
Terminal.app has a misfeature: it will modify the colors you set in preferences
according to its own liking, and you cannot disable this behaviour.

Therefore I strongly recommend that Mac users switch to
[iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/), which seems to be a much better terminal
emulator anyway. You can find Selenized color palette for iTerm
[here](../iterm/).



If you _really_ want it...
--------------------------

Copy the values from [here](../the-values.md) to Terminal.app's preferences.
Remember to use coordinates from correct color space.
