Selenized palette for Terminator
================================

Installation
------------

**Important note:** Terminator doesn't have any means of providing just the
color scheme, separated from other configuration.  Therefore I provide a
complete (but minimal) Terminator config file.

To install Selenized and overwrite your existing Terminator configuration, copy
[`config`](config) from this directory into `~/.config/terminator`.

To add Selenized profiles to your existing configuration, copy-and-paste
appropriate sections from [`config`](config) file into your
`~/.config/terminator/config`.
